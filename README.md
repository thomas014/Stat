# 📊 Advanced Statistical Analysis Tool

## 📖 Overview
A **privacy-first**, local statistical analysis application built with Python and Streamlit. Perform professional-grade statistical testing on your own computer without uploading your data to the cloud. Your data stays on your machine, always.

This tool bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insights by providing an **interactive educational guide**, automatically selecting appropriate visualizations, and performing advanced post-hoc analysis when needed.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔒 Privacy & Security
* **100% Local Processing:** Runs entirely on your machine. Your data never leaves your hard drive.
* **No External Dependencies:** No internet connection required after installation.

### 📘 Interactive Learning
* **Smart Method Guide:** Dynamic explanations that update based on your selected test, explaining *When*, *Why*, and *How* to use each method.
* **Comprehensive Test Information:** Includes assumptions, minimum sample sizes, null hypotheses, and interpretation guidance for every test.

### 🔬 Advanced Statistical Analysis

#### Normality Testing (Adaptive to Sample Size)
* **Small Samples (N < 50):** Shapiro-Wilk test with Z-score analysis
* **Medium Samples (50-300):** Lilliefors test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov adjusted)
* **Large Samples (N > 300):** Skewness and kurtosis evaluation
* **Per-Group Analysis:** Automatically checks normality for each group separately when applicable
* **Visual Diagnostics:** Histogram with normal curve overlay and Q-Q plots

#### Descriptive Statistics
* Automatically calculates group summaries: count, mean, **median**, standard deviation, min, and max
* Color-coded tables with gradient highlighting for easy interpretation

#### Statistical Tests Available

**One-Sample Tests (vs Reference Value):**
* One-Sample T-Test (for normal data)
* Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (for symmetric non-normal data)
* **Sign Test** (for skewed/asymmetric data)

**Two-Group Comparisons:**
* Independent T-Test (parametric)
* Mann-Whitney U Test (non-parametric)

**Multi-Group Comparisons (3+ groups):**
* One-Way ANOVA (parametric)
* Kruskal-Wallis Test (non-parametric)

**Correlation Analysis:**
* Pearson Correlation (linear relationships)
* Spearman Correlation (ranked/monotonic relationships)

**Categorical Analysis:**
* Chi-Square Test of Independence

#### Post-Hoc Analysis
* **Tukey HSD:** Automatically triggered after significant ANOVA results
* **Pairwise Mann-Whitney U:** Automatically triggered after significant Kruskal-Wallis results
* **Bonferroni Correction:** Applied to pairwise non-parametric tests to control family-wise error rate
* **Visual Results:** Confidence interval plots and heatmaps showing which groups differ

### 📈 Automated Visualizations
* **Distribution Plots:** Histograms with KDE and normal curve overlays
* **Q-Q Plots:** For assessing normality visually
* **Boxplots:** Automatically generated for group comparisons
* **Scatter Plots:** With regression lines for correlation analyses
* **Heatmaps:** For post-hoc pairwise comparison results

### 🧾 Calculation Details Panel
* **Real-Time Logging:** See exactly what calculations are being performed
* **Transparency:** View intermediate steps, data previews, and statistical values
* **Educational:** Learn how the analysis is conducted behind the scenes
* **Collapsible:** Toggle on/off to reduce clutter when not needed

  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Step 1: Upload Your Data
* Supported formats: **CSV** or **Excel** (.xlsx)
* Your data should have:
  - One column for the independent variable (groups/categories)
  - One column for the dependent variable (measurements/values)

### Step 2: Select Variables
* **X (Independent Variable):** Choose the column that represents groups or categories
* **Y (Dependent Variable):** Choose the column with numerical measurements

### Step 3: Review Distribution & Normality
* The tool automatically displays:
  - Group summary statistics
  - Normality test results (adaptive to sample size)
  - Histogram and Q-Q plots for visual assessment

### Step 4: Choose Statistical Test
* Select from 10 different statistical methods
* The built-in guide explains when to use each test
* For reference value comparisons, enter your reference number

### Step 5: Run Analysis
* Click "Run Analysis" to see results including:
  - Test statistics and p-values
  - Automatic post-hoc tests (when applicable)
  - Publication-ready visualizations
  - Detailed calculation logs (optional)

## 📊 Example Use Cases

### Comparing Drug Efficacy

## 🎓 Educational Features

### Understanding P-Values
* P < 0.05: Result is statistically significant (reject null hypothesis)
* P ≥ 0.05: Result is not significant (fail to reject null hypothesis)

### Normality Interpretation
* **Small samples:** Check if Z-scores are between -1.96 and +1.96
* **Medium samples:** Check if Z-scores are between -3.29 and +3.29
* **Large samples:** Check if |skewness| < 2.0 and |kurtosis| < 7.0

### Effect Size (Coming Soon)
Future versions will include effect size calculations (Cohen's d, eta-squared, etc.)
